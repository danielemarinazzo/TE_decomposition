# TE_decomposition
Code for the decomposition of transfer entropy through conditioning.

Please refer to Stramaglia, S., Faes, L., Cortes, J. M., & Marinazzo, D. (2024). Disentangling high order effects in the transfer entropy. [arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.03229](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03229).

The main script runs the toy model and computes the surrogate distribution when each new conditioning variable is added to the transfer entropy from the specified driver to the specified target, according to the paths maximizing synergy and redundancy.
